# Implement HTTP Operations in ASP.NET Core Razor Pages
This repository covers the implementation of HTTP operations within an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application. It includes adding the necessary code to create an HTTP client and handle operations such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manage data (a list of fruits).

**Objectives**:
After completing this module, you will be able to:

* Implement HTTP clients in .NET Core.
* Use HTTP clients to perform safe and unsafe operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* Add the required code to support HTTP operations in an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages app.

This repository is linked to the "Render API Responses in ASP.NET Core Razor Pages" repository,
which handles the frontend logic to display the data.
